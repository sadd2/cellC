# Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C++. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells on a grid can be alive or dead, and their state changes based on the states of their neighbors.

## Features

- A grid of cells that can be alive or dead.
- Random initialization of the grid.
- Updates the grid based on the rules of the Game of Life.
- Displays the grid in the console.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `game_of_life` directory.
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler, for example:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp game.cpp grid.cpp cell.cpp -o game_of_life
